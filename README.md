# Memoirs of a Dread Pirate
Memoirs of a Dread Pirate is a graphical text-based adventure game writen in Java 8.

During the Spring 2017 semester at Blackburn College, myself and five other students in the CS385 Junior Seminar class developed Memoirs of a Dread Pirate as our semester project. This is my fork of that project.
